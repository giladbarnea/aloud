        You are given a markdown representation of an article from the internet, generated automatically by a tool. This means that the markdown is not perfect.
        Often, at the bottom of the article, the article's real actual content would end, and after that, things that used to be the website's comment section, social media links, navigation elements and buttons would appear. Those elements are called "junk elements".
        What line concludes the real article, excluding the "junk elements"?
