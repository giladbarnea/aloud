# `aloud`

`aloud` is meant to be a text-to-speech tool that makes the listening experience actually interesting and compelling.

I've only just started, so contributions are welcome.

## Why?

There's just too many articles to read.

I can't read them all, but I can listen to them all while housekeeping, dogwalking and commuting.

## The problem with existing solutions

The rhetoric they provide is typically dull and non-engaging. This hurts comprehension and retention so much that it's usually a waste of time.

## How I plan to solve it

Mending the text with well designed LLM agents so that, when played through a high quality TTS provider (e.g ElevenLabs), it feels like someone is reading the text to you, rather than a robot spelling it out verbatim.
