Title: PromptLayer

This page covers how to use PromptLayer within LangChain. It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific PromptLayer wrappers.

Next Section: Installation and Setup

If you want to work with PromptLayer:

  * Install the promptlayer python library. There's a code block here that describes how to install the promptlayer library using pip: `pip install promptlayer`.
  * Create a PromptLayer account.
  * Create an api token and set it as an environment variable. There's a code block here that shows the environment variable to set for the API key: `PROMPTLAYER_API_KEY`.

Following Up: Wrappers

Subsection: LLM

There exists a PromptLayer OpenAI LLM wrapper, which you can access with the following code block:

    from langchain.llms import PromptLayerOpenAI

To tag your requests, use the argument `pl_tags` when initializing the LLM. Another code block describes how to initialize the LLM with tags:

    from langchain.llms import PromptLayerOpenAI
    llm = PromptLayerOpenAI(pl_tags=["langchain-requests", "chatbot"])

To get the PromptLayer request id, use the argument `return_pl_id` when initializing the LLM. An additional code block shows how to initialize the LLM to return a PromptLayer request ID:

    from langchain.llms import PromptLayerOpenAI
    llm = PromptLayerOpenAI(return_pl_id=True)

This will add the PromptLayer request ID in the `generation_info` field of the `Generation` returned when using `.generate` or `.agenerate`.

For example, there's a code block here that demonstrates how to retrieve the PromptLayer request ID from the results:

    llm_results = llm.generate(["hello world"])
    for res in llm_results.generations:
        print("pl request id: ", res[0].generation_info["pl_request_id"])

You can use the PromptLayer request ID to add a prompt, score, or other metadata to your request. There's a link to more information about it here.

This LLM is identical to the OpenAI LLM, except that:

  * all your requests will be logged to your PromptLayer account,
  * you can add `pl_tags` when instantiating to tag your requests on PromptLayer,
  * you can add `return_pl_id` when instantiating to return a PromptLayer request id to use while tracking requests.

PromptLayer also provides native wrappers for `PromptLayerChatOpenAI` and `PromptLayerOpenAIChat`.
