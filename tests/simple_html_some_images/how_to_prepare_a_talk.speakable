How to Prepare a Talk - By Gary Bernhardt


Once you have a talk idea (link to a blog post), it's time to build the talk.
Conference talks are scary, so you'll want to avoid it.
You'll silently make slides or silently write an outline.
These would be great preparations if you were going to stand on stage and perform the act of silently writing notes in a text editor.
You're going to stand on stage and talk, so your preparation should be made up primarily of talking.

I'll warn you up front: this process is labor-intensive.
Is 20 (or 50) hours too long to spend on a talk?
Well, suppose you have an audience of 500 people.
A 30-minute talk will consume 30*500 = 15,000 person-minutes, which is 250 person-hours.
Spending 20 of your hours to optimize 250 of other peoples' hours is a good trade-off.

Then there's the video.
A popular talk video can see 50,000 views or more.
With 50,000 views, you just optimized 25,000 person-hours, or about 3.9 person-years, all for the cost of 20 to 50 of your own hours.
Assuming 20 hours of prep, that's a 1,250-to-1 ratio of viewer time to preparation time.
Of course, the effort and practice you put in also increase the chance that 50,000 people will want to watch the talk!
In short: I think that, no, 20 hours isn't too long to spend.

I'll describe talk preparation as if you're actually doing it.
This isn't The One True Way to build a talk; the second person is just expedient.

A brief note on my credentials.
I've spoken at about fifty conferences.
As I write this,
my most popular full-length talk (link to destroyallsoftware domain) has been watched about half a million times.
Wat (another link to destroyallsoftware domain) has been watched at least three million times, but it's a lightning talk so the process described here didn't apply.
I also organize a conference (link with deconstructconf domain), whose site you're on now.


The Outline

Your first step is to choose a topic (link with deconstructconf.com domain); we'll assume that you've done that.
Find a room where no one can hear you.
Stand up and start talking about your topic to no one, projecting your voice rather than mumbling.
Wander around a bit.
In short: act like you're on stage.

Every part of this is important.
If no one can hear you, then you won't feel embarrassed to speak freely.
If you speak out loud, project your voice, and walk around a bit, then you'll condition yourself to stand on stage and give a talk.
By the time you're on stage, it'll be so ingrained that even performance stress won't stop you.
More on that later.

You'll be tempted to think "this part doesn't matter; I can do it silently and get the same effect."
You can't!
You can't learn to play a guitar by writing music, you can't learn to write by talking, and you can't learn to give a talk by writing an outline.
Every talk is new, so you have to relearn every time.
You need to hear the jokes to know whether they're funny; hear the pace to know whether you're becoming boring; and hear your confidence (or lack thereof) to tell you when you're straying into territory that you don't understand.

However, there's no need for a plan, and it's OK to digress into subtopics that go nowhere.
Your goal here is to discover what you know and what you might have to say, even if only 5% of it is used in the final talk.

Sometimes, as you walk around your empty living room and talk to yourself, you'll hear yourself say something novel.
When that happens, make a note of it in your slide software of choice.
Nothing fancy: just an empty slide with a couple words to remind you of the idea.

None of this has to be "good".
You don't have to sound "smart".
No one can hear you and no one will read your notes!
You're just finding out what you know.

Talk until you feel like you're out of ideas, whether it takes 15 minutes or two hours.
Then close your slide software; you're done for the day.


Repetition

You've now spent about an hour on your talk.
It's time to meet the core of the process: repetition.
You're going to repeat the talk many times, watching it change on its own.
You're not going to repeat the same words or even the same approximate paragraphs; it's not that kind of repetition.

Practice your talk three more times, in the same way as before: stand up and talk through the topic where no one can hear you.
Forget that you've already "given the talk".
Start back at the beginning, going wherever it takes you.
Like before, take notes as you go: add note slides to your existing slides, rearrange them if the ordering doesn't feel right, and don't be afraid to delete.

It's important to do this only once per day.
Your brief note slides will ensure that you don't forget any big points that seemed interesting in the past.
But you do want to forget the exact, fine-grained details of what you said.
Each time you come back to it the partial forgetting will lead you to discover new ways of approaching the core topic, as represented by your note slides.

Limiting yourself to an hour or so per day also stops it from feeling like work.
You'll notice new topics coming up, and your explanation of existing topics get tighter, both of which are very rewarding.

In these practice runs, look for consistent high points: do you perk up whenever you talk about a certain topic?
Can you make the other topics move "toward" those more exciting points, so the whole thing builds toward your favorite part?
If so, rearrange your note slides so that they build toward that point, then see whether tomorrow's run through seems to have a stronger direction.

You've now learned the core of this talk preparation technique: improvising over and over again.
You're not writing and memorizing a talk that's serialized into words; you're getting your thoughts themselves in order so that you understand them and can traverse them on stage.
The minor forgetting during your day-long breaks stops the talk from becoming rigid and robotic.
You always have to work a bit to find the individual words of the talk, even though the order of the ideas is similar each time.
